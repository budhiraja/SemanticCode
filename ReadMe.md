This site is about understanding semantic aspects of code using Word2Vec. I will update this site and the github repository with a code notebook in some days. Meanwhile, enjoy the blog post at medium: <URL> and visualizations for embeddings of code unigrams trained via Skipgram word2vec model: https://budhiraja.github.io/SemanticCode/UnigramsVectors.html and for file embeddings using these unigram embeddings at: https://budhiraja.github.io/SemanticCode/FileVectors_W2V.html
  
  Please create issues in case you find something off in this or if you find interesting too!
